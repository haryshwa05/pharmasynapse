✅ FIRST: What Your App MUST Have (Non-Negotiable Features)
These are the functional must-haves that match EXACTLY what the judges expect:

1. Master Agent (Brain)
Handles:
Interpret query


Break into tasks


Dispatch to worker agents


Merge results


Produce a PDF report


Tech to use:
Python FastAPI backend


LangGraph or CrewAI for agent workflow


OpenAI API (BUT with small cheap model or FREE mock inference for agents)


You can literally mock 70% of agent outputs to avoid costs.

2. Worker Agents
Each agent = one Python module + mock API.
a) IQVIA Insights Agent
Input → molecule or therapy
 Output →
Market size table


Competitors


CAGR


Use a JSON file instead of paying for IQVIA.

b) EXIM Trends Agent
Input → API/formulation
 Output →
Import/export graph


Dependency risk


Same: JSON file + generate matplotlib chart.

c) Patent Landscape Agent
Input → molecule
 Output →
List of patents


Status (active/expired)


FTO flags


Use USPTO mock API → static JSON + GPT summary.

d) Clinical Trials Agent
Input → disease or molecule
 Output →
Ongoing trials


Sponsors


Trial phases


Use ClinicalTrials.gov stub (they give mock data).

e) Internal Knowledge Agent
Summarize PDF


Extract insights


Use PyPDF + GPT.
Only pay for this when demoing — costs very little.

f) Web Intelligence Agent
Simulated Google search


Summaries of guidelines


Scientific review


Use a custom JSON file containing fake URLs + extracted text.

g) Report Generator Agent
Outputs:
Beautiful PDF with tables, plots, executive summary
